# COVID-19-Data-Analyisis
######So here I'm, With Coronavirus on everyoneâ€™s mind and forcing almost all of us indoors, many in the ML community are wondering how they might help. I had collected a dataset which contains all the names of states of India, confirmed Covid-19 cases, Deaths, Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the states. After that, I had come up with an idea to develop a python script using pandas and folium which will help to visualize the map of India with its states and confirmed cases and also to assign colours to the markers of the states according to the range of confirmed cases like if the range of confirmed cases is greater than 2000 so it is assigned a dark red colour which means Alert and similarly rest of the markers are assigned. This will help to visualize the Covid-19 Cases State-wise in India., Thank you, and follow @ajcodes_  for more. . #stayhomestaysafe
